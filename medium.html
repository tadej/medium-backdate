The multiplayer space is currently dominated by big studios with big budgets. Top titles are becoming services, while single-player campaigns are being pushed into the background.
With increasing access to high bandwidth, powerful devices and cloud technology, the number of potential players is higher than ever — but so is the demand for variety.
High stakes and budgets make big players stick to proven concepts — they avoid taking the kind of creative risks players are hungry for. For that, we need indies.
However, small independent developers mostly steer away from online multiplayer. The technical barrier to entry is still high, and hard limitations on the server side restrict the kinds of games that can be created.
